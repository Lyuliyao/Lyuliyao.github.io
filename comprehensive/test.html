Let's refine the text in the aside sections to make it more fluent, colloquial yet academic:

1. **Consensus-based Sampling**
   - *Original*: Direct application of existing adversarial generative models is not feasible as the global residual error is unknown a priori. Generating a network to represent the target distribution \( q \) or error function \( L \) is not simpler than reconstructing FES. We employ a consensus-based sampling in the form of a stochastic interacting particle system governed by over-damping Langevin dynamics. A quadratic potential is adaptively constructed to probe the local maximum error regime by exploiting the Laplace approximation under a low-temperature limit.
   - *Revised*: Directly applying existing adversarial generative models isn’t feasible due to the a priori unknown global residual error. Creating a network to represent the target distribution \( q \) or error function \( L \) isn’t any simpler than reconstructing FES. We utilize consensus-based sampling through a stochastic interacting particle system, governed by over-damped Langevin dynamics. An adaptive quadratic potential helps probe the local maximum error regime, leveraging the Laplace approximation in a low-temperature limit.

2. **Exploitation and Exploration in the Max-Problem**
   - *Original*: In order to approximate the target distribution, especially near the max-residual point, we leverage Laplace's principle from large deviations theory. This principle is expressed as: [Equation] This equation holds true for any compactly supported probability measure \(\rho^{\ast}\), where max-residual point \(\bz^{\ast} \in \supp(\rho^*)\) is the unique minimizer of the function \(f\).
   - *Revised*: To approximate the target distribution, particularly near the max-residual point, we draw upon Laplace's principle from large deviations theory, expressed as: [Equation]. This holds for any compactly supported probability measure \(\rho^{\ast}\), with the max-residual point \(\bz^{\ast} \in \supp(\rho^*)\) being the unique minimizer of function \(f\).

3. **Exploitation and Exploration in the Max-Problem (Continued)**
   - *Original*: This enables us to identify the max-residual point from a collection of samples by the first-order momentum $\bm$ under the weighted density function $p(\bz)$, where $\kappa_l^{-1}$ represents a low temperature limit. However, the integration is subject to the so-called curse of dimensionality as the number of CVs increases.
   - *Revised*: This approach allows us to pinpoint the max-residual point from a sample collection using the first-order momentum $\bm$, under the weighted density function $p(\bz)$, with $\kappa_l^{-1}$ representing a low-temperature limit. Nonetheless, the integration faces the challenge of the curse of dimensionality as the number of CVs escalates.

4. **Exploitation and Exploration in the Max-Problem (Further)**
   - *Original*: We treat sampler \( \bz^i \) as a random walker \( \bz^i_t \) governed by the McKean stochastic differential equation. This approach allows for adaptability and reactivity to the existing state of the system, navigating the random walkers towards the region of large residual error represented by \( \bm_t \). The adaptive construction of the conservative potential function \( G(\bz_t) \) navigates the individual particles towards \( \bm_t \), representing the region of large residual error. It is crucial to underscore that \( \bm_t \) is dictated by prior sampling, rendering \( \mathcal{A}(\bz_t) \) adaptable and reactive to the existing state of the system. The stochastic term in the equation represents the standard Gaussian white noise characterized by zero mean and covariance, where \( \gamma \) represents the friction coefficient. The balance between exploitation and exploration is controlled using two temperatures $\kappa_l^{-1}$ and $\kappa_h^{-1}$. As $\kappa_l^{-1}$ decreases, the random walker distribution concentrates near the max-residual points of the current model, reflecting the role of exploitation. Conversely, as $\kappa_h^{-1}$ increases, the distribution smoothens progressively, enhancing the exploration of the uncharted regions.
   - *Revised*: We view the sampler \( \bz^i \) as a random walker \( \bz^i_t \), governed by the McKean stochastic differential equation, allowing adaptability and reactivity to the system's current state, steering the random walkers towards the region of large residual error represented by \( \bm_t \). The adaptively constructed conservative potential function \( G(\bz_t) \) guides individual particles towards \( \bm_t \), indicative of the region of large residual error. It’s vital to highlight that \( \bm_t \) is influenced by prior sampling, making \( \mathcal{A}(\bz_t) \) adaptable and reactive to the system's current state. The equation's stochastic term denotes the standard Gaussian white noise, characterized by zero mean and covariance, with \( \gamma \) as the friction coefficient. The equilibrium between exploitation and exploration is managed through two temperatures $\kappa_l^{-1}$ and $\kappa_h^{-1}$. A decrease in $\kappa_l^{-1}$ concentrates the random walker distribution near the current model's max-residual points, signifying exploitation, while an increase in $\kappa_h^{-1}$ progressively smoothens the distribution, fostering exploration of unknown regions.

5. **Proposition and Remarks**
   - *Original*: But the a good quaditical approximation is not a defined. One thing we can prove is that if the erro space take a quadratic form, then we can prove the convergence to q hat we want rigouriusly.
   - *Revised*: However, a good quadratic approximation isn’t explicitly defined. What we can assert is that if the error space assumes a quadratic form, we can rigorously demonstrate convergence to the desired \( q \).

   - *Original*: The first remark is that if error is not quadratic but the Hessian matrix is positive defined with upper and below bound, the correction of the algorithm can be justification, by the distrubition function is also bounded by related bounds.
   - *Revised*: The initial remark is that even if the error isn’t quadratic, but the Hessian matrix is positively defined with upper and lower bounds, the algorithm’s correction can be justified, as the distribution function is also constrained by related bounds.

   - *Original*: Even though all prove is in the Mean field theory, where number of partile need to go to infty, but the convergence guaranteed with parameter constraints independent of the dimensionality, which overrid the curse of dimensionality.
   - *Revised*: Although all proofs are within the realm of Mean Field Theory, where the number of particles must approach infinity, convergence is assured with parameter constraints that are independent of dimensionality, thereby overcoming the curse of dimensionality.
